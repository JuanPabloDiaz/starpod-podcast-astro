# Starpod

Starpod aims to be the easiest way to create a podcast website by only providing
your RSS url and some optional image assets and colors.

### RSS URL

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root and set your RSS URL like so:

```
PUBLIC_PODCAST_RSS_FEED="https://anchor.fm/s/e329dea0/podcast/rss"
```
