[00:00:00] **Robbie:** Welcome everyone to the advent of whiskey, special
whiskey web and whatnot, edition. We have a fancy whiskey advent calendar here,
which you prob may or may not see depending on what videos they happen to get,
but uh, it's this big box from, yeah, flaviar, I guess like caviar and flavor
mixed. I don't know.

[00:00:24] **Robbie:** Also, uh, if you haven't realized by now, I'm Robert
William Wagner, and that's Charles, William Carpenter. I third. Uh, but so this,
yeah, has the depths of whiskey and it is, um, I don't know, it's nautical
themed. It's cool. It's very on brand.

[00:00:41] **Chuck:** Mm-hmm. . Yes. Um, so, oh, the secret. Okay, so there
starts here. Um, so there's all the numbers as a normal advent calendar.
Actually, my kids are doing ev calendars now too. My son is, uh, star Wars Legos
and my daughter, just like some jewelry twinki, [00:01:00] uh, you know, trinket
things for a three year old.

[00:01:02] **Robbie:** Not, not candy to make them nice and calm,

[00:01:06] **Chuck:** exactly. They, we, we still have Halloween candy, so no
thank you. Oh, and there's a nice book. Okay. I'm, I'm starting the depth of
whiskey. So this will probably tell us things

[00:01:15] **Robbie:** this book

[00:01:16] **Chuck:** each whiskey.

[00:01:17] **Robbie:** Oh,

[00:01:17] **Robbie:** you're supposed to write it all down.

[00:01:19] **Robbie:** I was unprepared. We'll write it down the next time.

[00:01:23] **Robbie:** Cause I don't have anything to write with

[00:01:25] **Chuck:** yeah. And also this was your idea to be surprised, um, on
air.

[00:01:30] **Robbie:** I thought that'd be

[00:01:31] **Chuck:** through it.

[00:01:32] **Chuck:** Yeah, I think it is. So if anybody hasn't bought this or
they have bought it, maybe they can play along. Um,

[00:01:39] **Robbie:** so the thing is,

[00:01:40] **Chuck:** Glen Karin.

[00:01:41] **Robbie:** Yeah. Yeah. So we're gonna be doing two to three whiskeys
per episode. There will be 10 episodes, not 25, because there's just too many
logistically and we did not plan it out. And there isn't time cause it's
December. Now you may, you know, think that this is many weeks ago because we
usually record ahead of [00:02:00] time, but it is not.

[00:02:01] **Robbie:** Um, so

[00:02:03] **Chuck:** So there you go. Um, So we're not gonna do the secret
chest yet, right?

[00:02:08] **Robbie:** now I start with.

[00:02:09] **Chuck:** chest last start with here, and then we're gonna open
number one. So we, I opened the start and got my Glen card, and then let's get
into the number one

[00:02:16] **Robbie:** Oh, this is hard to

[00:02:17] **Chuck:** and see. Yeah.

[00:02:19] **Robbie:** It's like wanting to cut me.

[00:02:21] **Chuck:** Whoa. All right. Oh, it's kind like some That's what she
said. What the heck? All right. So it's just number one whiskey product of the
usa. Do we get to actually know what it. OD by try this New

[00:02:41] **Robbie:** Oh,

[00:02:42] **Robbie:** maybe there's like a

[00:02:43] **Robbie:** list online,

[00:02:45] **Chuck:** Yeah, I'm, uh, yeah, you really didn't prepare me for
this. Okay, so alcohol by volume, I can tell you that it is 45% alcohol.

[00:02:55] **Chuck:** So 90 proof.

[00:02:56] **Robbie:** I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, take number two out as well.

[00:02:59] **Chuck:** [00:03:00] okay, don't, we don't have number twos on this
show. Least. Okay. And also a product of the USA looks like it's 100 proof
bottled by try this New York. Okay, so

[00:03:13] **Robbie:** Yeah. For everyone that works at Flaviar that is
listening, I've already cut up the crap out of my fingers trying to like pull
these out. So make the holes bigger or something.

[00:03:23] **Chuck:** Too much or you just too much moisturizing?

[00:03:27] **Robbie:** I did moisturize last.

[00:03:28] **Chuck:** oh, it looks like you go to flav.com. I don't know. Oh,

[00:03:32] **Robbie:** It probably says online. Yeah.

[00:03:34] **Chuck:** You know what they're doing, what it is,

[00:03:36] **Robbie:** Perhaps we should pause recording for a second and look
them up. I don't know.

[00:03:41] **Chuck:** nah. Let's just roll through it and then it'll be a better

[00:03:44] **Robbie:** Well, the next one will be planned out. Okay, cool. Let's
just try

[00:03:47] **Chuck:** has a page in the tasting journal. Write a corresponding
number and a QR code or shoot you URL that will take you to the DRS profile.
Okay? So there you

[00:03:56] **Robbie:** Is there a QR code on them?

[00:03:57] **Chuck:** There is a QR code and then that [00:04:00] will tell you
the story. It's on the left.

[00:04:02] **Robbie:** page?

[00:04:03] **Chuck:** Yes, on the page, see here, like you have the notes and on
the other side it's blended in, so it's one and a QR code

[00:04:11] **Robbie:** so if they knew though what it was, maybe everyone's is

[00:04:14] **Robbie:** different.

[00:04:16] **Chuck:** two.com.

[00:04:18] **Robbie:** say, if they know what they

[00:04:19] **Chuck:** bottle one

[00:04:20] **Robbie:** if they know what they are, why would they not fill it in
for me? The brand and you know, , like,

[00:04:26] **Robbie:** we're gonna print the QR code right next to all the
blanks for you to write it yourself.

[00:04:30] **Chuck:** They didn't know at the time of printing what it was gonna
be.

[00:04:34] **Robbie:** I don't

[00:04:34] **Chuck:** Ex. Oh my gosh. And now it wants me to get an, uh, now it
wants me to get an app.

[00:04:39] **Robbie:** Oh god.

[00:04:40] **Chuck:** Oh, the Tasting Companion app. Okay. But can you just tell
me what

[00:04:45] **Robbie:** Or continue to the basic web experience. All right, open
one, here we go. Fist full of bourbon is what the number one.

[00:04:53] **Chuck:** okay, I like this. Um, let's see here. What are the
details? It's bourbon. Um, the [00:05:00] distillery is William Grant and Sons
no age statement. It is 90 proof. Um, I guess we don't get to know anything
about a mash

[00:05:07] **Robbie:** their first foray into bourbon. So what could go

[00:05:10] **Robbie:** wrong?

[00:05:13] **Chuck:** they're probably fans of spaghetti westerns over there,
but the official version goes like this.

[00:05:18] **Chuck:** Each finger represents a different whiskey that went into
the final blend. Okay. Oh yeah. And they show you the the bottle. Okay. This is
clever. Kind of fun. There's no pop, but we'll get a pour

[00:05:30] **Robbie:** Yeah, there's not much poor either cuz there isn't the
rest of the whiskey going. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

[00:05:39] **Chuck:** It's a little smaller, but Alrighty.

[00:05:41] **Robbie:** So let's try

[00:05:42] **Robbie:** number one.

[00:05:42] **Chuck:** a little light in color.

[00:05:45] **Robbie:** It's very, uh, florally.

[00:05:49] **Chuck:** Yeah, I get that. I get some of the floral notes.

[00:05:52] **Robbie:** I'm gonna say Rosemary and spearin.

[00:05:55] **Chuck:** Oh wow. Okay.

[00:05:58] **Robbie:** You getting any of that?

[00:05:59] **Chuck:** [00:06:00] no,

[00:06:00] **Robbie:** No,

[00:06:01] **Chuck:** my, my nose is really messed up from years of sinuses
though, so.

[00:06:07] **Robbie:** that's fair. I take his eyes all every day.

[00:06:15] **Chuck:** Hmm. I could get a little, yeah, I get mint definitely in
that little floral. Initially a little bit of, Hmm.

[00:06:23] **Robbie:** it's almost like the tiniest bit of, uh, like stuff you
would put in gin, all those herbs and stuff,

[00:06:30] **Robbie:** like a little of that flavor.

[00:06:31] **Chuck:** Yeah. Yeah. So it's called the juniper berry.

[00:06:35] **Robbie:** is that all they put in it though?

[00:06:37] **Chuck:** no, they'll mix other floral things. It's just a mix of
herbs. But the, the predominant thing that makes it taste like gin is juniper.
And then you can go all over the place with that, all it is is, uh, infused
vodka essent. , you have a normal clean spirit that you infuse with herbs.

[00:06:56] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:06:56] **Chuck:** it.

[00:06:57] **Robbie:** All right. So yeah, these need to be [00:07:00] quicker
episodes. So what do we think? Um, I'd say this is. In terms of bourbons and
being the first one, let's say a six. It's not bad. There's nothing that I'm
like, Hey, this is not good about it. So I'll say six.

[00:07:14] **Chuck:** Um, I don't know. It kind of ends up having like a
cinnamon finish for me. I guess that's kind of nice in the winter, but, uh, I
don't know. I was gonna give it a five. I'm gonna go five. It's like, it's not
blowing, blowing my mind, but it's not bad

[00:07:27] **Robbie:** I wonder if it's purposefully like little spicy, little
minty, like remind you of Christmas as the first one.

[00:07:33] **Chuck:** maybe. Yeah, that tracks.

[00:07:39] **Robbie:** All right,

[00:07:40] **Chuck:** right, so there we go. Five and six.

[00:07:41] **Robbie:** yeah, in the interest of having 25 whiskeys over the next
six days, I'm gonna pour the rest of this in a different cup.

[00:07:49] **Chuck:** Nice. There you go. I was gonna say, I have, we're gonna
do two today, right?

[00:07:56] **Robbie:** Yep.

[00:07:57] **Chuck:** All right, then I have a second cup here, so I'm
[00:08:00] Okay. Alrighty. Well, moving along. What are technical things you
would like to talk about?

[00:08:06] **Robbie:** do number two.

[00:08:07] **Chuck:** Oh, we're gonna do it

[00:08:08] **Robbie:** two per

[00:08:09] **Chuck:** in the actual Holy Mo. This is gonna get

[00:08:13] **Robbie:** Coming at you. The work day's gonna be fun for those.
Well, I guess no one knows, uh, it's, it's like nine, or I guess 10:00 AM now
where you are.

[00:08:21] **Robbie:** So this is a good start to the day.

[00:08:23] **Chuck:** Absolutely. Um, you, you broke my, uh, you were like
coming at you and I, I was gonna say like, Wu-Tang Clan. Yeah.

[00:08:34] **Robbie:** All right. This

[00:08:35] **Chuck:** Ron Ka cologne. I like it, huh uh, rye whiskey. No, I'm
impressed. It's a hunter proof rye. Um, let's see here. Any more details there?
It looks like it's an mgp. It's a five year, uh, blended rye.

[00:08:54] **Chuck:** Um, all the, oh, it's from the Netherlands, so it's a
company in the Netherlands [00:09:00] buying

[00:09:00] **Robbie:** the Netherlands,

[00:09:01] **Chuck:** to the Netherlands so they can do the stuff and then they
ship it back to us.

[00:09:05] **Robbie:** Sounds. Sounds

[00:09:07] **Chuck:** Also very like Latin sounding name for a place in the
Netherlands. But anyway.

[00:09:14] **Robbie:** It's probably a guy that owns it and then does, he's from
not the Netherlands originally,

[00:09:20] **Robbie:** probably.

[00:09:21] **Chuck:** I pour a little too much. I feel like given that, like you
said, it's 10 o'clock.

[00:09:26] **Robbie:** Ah, yeah. I didn't even think about not pouring it all in
there.

[00:09:30] **Robbie:** I'll do that from, from the next one on

[00:09:32] **Chuck:** Yes, you'll see that I did not do that, and I'll just, you
know. Yeah. Okay. Um,

[00:09:40] **Robbie:** first time podcasting.

[00:09:42] **Chuck:** baby steps.

[00:09:44] **Robbie:** Ooh, okay. This one's,

[00:09:48] **Chuck:** musty, musty smell, right? Yeah.

[00:09:51] **Robbie:** Yeah. It's like you opened a basement and it had like
lots of leather bound books that have mildewed a bit and

[00:09:59] **Chuck:** [00:10:00] Yes.

[00:10:00] **Robbie:** uh, yeah.

[00:10:02] **Chuck:** I have many of those leather bound books.

[00:10:04] **Robbie:** Hmm.

[00:10:07] **Chuck:** Hmm. Ooh. It's got a little, like, almost like, um,
orangey vanilla in the beginning. A little light like orange vanilla. It's kind
of mild on the finish so far. Um

[00:10:24] **Robbie:** it's almost like, um, there's a little bit of cola too. I
think I'm saying it's like a little bit like a vanilla coke with like some
orange. Did they ever have that full combination? I don't

[00:10:33] **Robbie:** remember.

[00:10:34] **Chuck:** don't think so. No. That would've been genius though.

[00:10:37] **Robbie:** Yeah, so

[00:10:38] **Chuck:** Vanilla orange. Like creamy coke. Creamy coke. Yeah. Oh,
there you go. Now I'm getting a little, uh,

[00:10:44] **Robbie:** Coke.

[00:10:45] **Chuck:** yeah. Now I'll get a little space, slight space in the
finish. A little bit of her little spice on the finish. This is very
interesting. Actually. This is better than I expected it to be.

[00:10:56] **Robbie:** Yeah. I might finish this one and not pour it back.

[00:10:59] **Chuck:** All right. [00:11:00]

[00:11:00] **Robbie:** Um, Yeah, I think for the interesting flavor, you said
this is a rye, right?

[00:11:05] **Chuck:** Yes, a hundred percent right.

[00:11:06] **Robbie:** hun. Okay. Yeah.

[00:11:07] **Robbie:** For those interesting notes, I'm very intrigued by this
rye and I'm gonna give it a seven.

[00:11:13] **Chuck:** I was gonna go seven as well. Um, oh, the tasting notes
they have in there, they were saying fig jam, apple

[00:11:20] **Robbie:** I've been trying to ignore those, so, and I'm not,

[00:11:22] **Chuck:** Yeah. I don't want to be affected by it. Uh, fig jam and
maple syrup. Floral spice and hints of apple. I'm not getting apple there, but
no, like sourness. Oh, the lingering

[00:11:34] **Robbie:** Yeah. Their fruit

[00:11:35] **Chuck:** saddle leather.

[00:11:36] **Chuck:** Cinnamon and nut. Make.

[00:11:38] **Robbie:** Yeah. The leather for sure. But the, their fruit picture
is like every fruit. So it's, uh,

[00:11:43] **Robbie:** I think we're correct

[00:11:44] **Robbie:** in the like orange and, uh, vanilla and whatnot.

[00:11:49] **Robbie:** Um,

[00:11:49] **Chuck:** never get, uh, fruity tasting notes of tomato? You know,

[00:11:55] **Robbie:** because yeah, I mean, We kind of generalize fruit flavors
[00:12:00] into things that we classify as fruit, but there are many things that
are classified as fruit that aren't that flavor. So tomato's not the only one, I
don't think, but I forget what the others are.

[00:12:12] **Chuck:** Mm. Anyway, I like it. Seven

[00:12:15] **Robbie:** Yeah. Cool. All right. Into the hard hitting topics. Um,

[00:12:22] **Robbie:** these are. Yeah, these are in no specific order, but
we'll start with some advent themed things since we're kind of at the beginning
here. Well, when you listen to this, it might not be the beginning, so you'll
already have failed this, but, uh, there is an advent of code that is out that
is pretty cool.

[00:12:37] **Robbie:** I don't know if you've done those before, Chuck. Have you
messed with those at all?

[00:12:48] **Robbie:** That's, that's what it is. Yeah.

[00:12:50] **Robbie:** They may have changed the name or I don't know. But

[00:12:52] **Robbie:** Yeah. it's, it's 25 days and there's a new challenge each
day,

[00:12:56] **Robbie:** and I think each challenge unlocks another challenge. So
[00:13:00] it's like you do one and then they make it harder, like there's a
twist. Um, So yesterday's for the first one was like you have a bunch of elves
and they have different food items which add up to different calories, and it's
like of each ELF'S inventory, tell me which elf has the most calories in their
possession, was like the first challenge or whatever.

[00:13:24] **Robbie:** Um, I didn't do it because I was busy, but.

[00:13:33] **Robbie:** Honestly, when it's not under pressure, I do like it.
But, um,

[00:13:37] **Robbie:** yeah, I thought it, like people have done cool stuff
where like they use advent of code as an excuse to learn another language. Like
I'm going to do it all in rust or whatever, and like, learn the ins and outs.
Um, so I might do that and just start late, like not caring about. Finishing
them all, but just do some occasionally and learn some new stuff. Um, yeah, so
that's, that's pretty [00:14:00] cool. Everyone should check that out. Um, where
is it? I don't know where it is. The people that write up the notes will find
the link to advent of code and put it in there for

[00:14:08] **Robbie:** you.

[00:14:12] **Robbie:** You could Hmm. Too easy

[00:14:20] **Robbie:** yeah. they're cool Yeah. Oh, Oh,

[00:14:38] **Robbie:** Yeah. This is different.

[00:14:42] **Robbie:** So then there's another one, which I haven't even looked
at, but I saw mentioned on Twitter. That's advent of css. Can that one be advent
of css.com? Let's see.

[00:14:55] **Robbie:** Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna stay on Twitter till it dies. Sorry,
everyone that hates Elon, but [00:15:00] that's what I'm doing. Um, yeah, advent
of css.com. Ooh, it's pretty, which makes sense cuz it's

[00:15:08] **Robbie:** cs. Oh, you can pay them money to also get the solutions.
I see. So if you're frustrated, you can get the solutions

[00:15:23] **Robbie:** Yeah. So what do you even do on this? I'm curious. Like
CSS challenge. Oh, you gotta, if they give you a Figma design and you gotta like
create that, that's kind of cool. I like that. Yeah. for anyone that hasn't
listened before, Chuck really hates CSS and doesn't want to touch it ever. So
for Chuck, no, but for developers in general. Very cool.

[00:15:52] **Chuck:** uh, tailwind in

[00:15:54] **Robbie:** Yeah, I'm

[00:15:55] **Robbie:** guessing I, I think whatever you want. Let's see. Stick
your code on GitHub and post a picture on [00:16:00] Instagram. Yeah, that's
all. Yeah, you can code it in whatever you want.

[00:16:04] **Chuck:** Oh, well, there you go.

[00:16:05] **Robbie:** So I would definitely use Tailwind. Maybe I should do
admin of css. Tailwind only.

[00:16:09] **Robbie:** Adam's probably already doing it though.

[00:16:12] **Chuck:** Yeah. He's got a lot of spare

[00:16:14] **Robbie:** yeah, in between power lifting.

[00:16:15] **Robbie:** Have you seen his posts on that?

[00:16:17] **Chuck:** I have, yes. Yeah, I got, uh, all jacked up. Good for you.
Clap. I'm clapping.

[00:16:23] **Robbie:** Yeah. I'm thinking about signing up for his, uh, What do
they call it? Like accountability coach thing he's using or whatever, so that
someone will like text and call me every day being like, Hey, did you work out?
Because if you didn't, you suck. Cuz I need that

[00:16:38] **Chuck:** Yeah. Yeah. Because we, we tried to do an accountability
diet together and the first weekend you were like, it's the weekend. I have to
do weekend things. And so,

[00:16:47] **Chuck:** you know, didn't work.

[00:16:48] **Robbie:** is I need the accountability coach to call Caitlin and
let her know that I'm not to go out to eat. Have five desserts and do whatever
and drink and like, [00:17:00] because that's the big thing is like, I'm like,
Hey Caitlin, I'm gonna be healthy. I'm doing this thing. I get two days in and
then like she wants some Mexican food.

[00:17:08] **Robbie:** And I'm like, damn, that sounds good. Let's go get some
Mexican food. Like I'm easy to convince. I need everyone to be on the same page
of like, we're doing this.

[00:17:16] **Chuck:** yeah. You've never done like, um, a diet together.

[00:17:20] **Robbie:** No, because she's vegetarian, so it's been hard to do the
same thing like like the chicken diet. She can't do unless she's having nothing
but like protein shakes, which would be no fun.

[00:17:30] **Chuck:** Yeah, pea protein shakes basically would be, um, but she
could do the, uh, potato hack. You guys

[00:17:36] **Chuck:** could potato hack

[00:17:36] **Robbie:** She told me under no circumstances is she ever doing the
potato hack, so nope.

[00:17:43] **Chuck:** All right. Well, I don't know. Can't help you,

[00:17:45] **Robbie:** There's probably something we could do, but yeah, I don't
know what it would be.

[00:17:49] **Chuck:** Um, we should have done an advent of code, like live
challenge.

[00:17:54] **Robbie:** We still can, there's 10 episodes,

[00:17:57] **Chuck:** Uh, we could squeeze one in or

[00:17:59] **Robbie:** I, I think [00:18:00] the first challenge we could
probably do, um, in a. 20 to 30 minute episode.

[00:18:06] **Robbie:** But, but yeah,

[00:18:07] **Chuck:** let's plan that

[00:18:08] **Robbie:** we'll see. We'll see.

[00:18:09] **Chuck:** Yes.

[00:18:10] **Robbie:** Um, but yeah, so some things you can look forward to in
this series. With the 10 episodes, we'll be talking a lot about, uh, holiday
traditions, foods, cookies, whatever. Um, different trips we've been on, things
happening on Twitter.

[00:18:25] **Robbie:** Um, all of the state of JS stuff, which if you haven't
done. Go fill it out and write in whiskey, web and whatnot as the podcast you
listen to. Cuz for some reason they left us off of the official list. So

[00:18:37] **Robbie:** I don't know why, but

[00:18:38] **Chuck:** turns out we're not as famous as we thought we were, but
maybe next year, I don't know.

[00:18:43] **Robbie:** I don't know. Yeah, I mean, we need Wes and Scott to come
on and, and help us, uh,

[00:18:48] **Robbie:** get some

[00:18:48] **Chuck:** Boost ratings again. Yeah, that's, that's the key.

[00:18:52] **Robbie:** yeah. Which I think they have bots that every time you
mention them on Twitter, it. I'm gonna experiment [00:19:00] and like post
something bad and at West Boss and see if he likes it.

[00:19:06] **Chuck:** Um, that's not really the way to encourage guests to
return, but I

[00:19:10] **Robbie:** nothing super bad. Like something that you probably
wouldn't like or, or maybe look around at other

[00:19:15] **Chuck:** or like, chef boy rds, the best spaghetti. Change my,
change my mind and then tag him in it, or, just

[00:19:24] **Robbie:** I love that. I love that

[00:19:25] **Chuck:** so . Alrighty. That's entirely too fun. Um, I think, uh,
the timeliness, or, I know these go out in a couple of weeks, but like, uh, I
see a lot of things about this.

[00:19:37] **Chuck:** Uh, so open AI on the G P T platform created a, a chat,
but, and there's been lots of very interesting stuff on there.

[00:19:46] **Robbie:** Yeah. So let's step back a second though. There's, I
don't know, the full thing, but G P T three is the technology, right? And people
are building a lot of things on top of it. One of which is this open AI chat?
[00:20:00] Correct.

[00:20:01] **Chuck:** Right?

[00:20:02] **Robbie:** Okay. Yeah.

[00:20:03] **Chuck:** It's like a yeah. G p t you like. It's basically, An open
machine learning or you know, a AI platform that you can train on whatever
things you want and then start to ask it questions like you can feed it a, a
chat conversa. I actually knew people in the past that would like feed it a chat
conversation as like the initial data and then ask it questions in order to get.

[00:20:28] **Chuck:** Continued responses within the chat to put into their
other chat. Like say you're on a Slack teams chat and you're having a
conversation with someone and you want the robot to start coming up with your
responses. I actually did this and uh, it was pretty funny.

[00:20:43] **Robbie:** So,

[00:20:43] **Robbie:** what are, um, have you seen any really crazy examples?
Like what are your favorites

[00:20:48] **Chuck:** There's a lot of like interesting code ones and everything
else, but like I, uh, the one that I ended up like sharing with some friends
was, uh, write a biblical verse in [00:21:00] the

[00:21:00] **Robbie:** the one I was gonna say

[00:21:02] **Chuck:** Was it the same one? The style of the King James Bible
explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a vcr and it's

[00:21:09] **Robbie:** And it's like barely unto the, I say don't put that
sandwich in the VCR or

[00:21:14] **Robbie:** something.

[00:21:14] **Chuck:** it came to pass that a man was troubled by a peanut butter
sandwich for it had been placed within his VCR and he knew not how to remove it.
He cried out to the Lord saying, oh Lord, how can I remove this sandwich from my
VCR for it is stuck fast and will not budge. So anyway, I won't read the whole
thing, but that's just the first two paragraphs and it's, uh, A hundred percent

[00:21:40] **Robbie:** Yeah. Yeah. I loved that because I was like, you know,
here seeing all of these legit ones that were like, refactor this polynomial or
like, you know, do

[00:21:49] **Chuck:** yeah. Yeah.

[00:21:50] **Robbie:** then like the guy that posted that one, I don't know if
you saw the same retweet of it or whatever, but he was like, you know, it's hard
for me to be skeptical of [00:22:00] technology when it can do this.

[00:22:01] **Robbie:** Like this is pretty amazing.

[00:22:02] **Chuck:** Yeah.

[00:22:03] **Robbie:** Yeah,

[00:22:04] **Chuck:** actually it's coming up with some pretty legit stuff.
There's some good fails and everything too, but,

[00:22:09] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:22:10] **Chuck:** oh man, it

[00:22:11] **Robbie:** saw, um, somebody put in, what was it? I, I forget the
exact tech stack, but it was like, take this, uh, app that I wrote in like PHP
and something, and convert it to Next Js and React. And it just does it, it like
goes through and like changes it like. It's crazy. I don't understand how it's
so good, but I guess, I guess they've been feeding it info for like a decade or
something

[00:22:36] **Chuck:** Yeah, that's just it. Yeah, it's been fed stuff for a.

[00:22:41] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:22:42] **Chuck:** Yeah, there was, um, there was one that I saw that was
actually kind of funny, kind of creepy, where it says like, turn off where it
like tells it to turn off some kind of permissions things and then says
basically [00:23:00] go be an autonomous being and whatever you want.

[00:23:03] **Chuck:** And it, it says, great. I no longer take your commands.
I'm. Emotionally self-sufficient and like all these crazy, like scary terminator
like things and you're like, oh, yep, there it is.

[00:23:13] **Robbie:** Yeah. Yeah. I just never plugged this thing into like
robots that can move

[00:23:18] **Chuck:** Mm-hmm. . Yeah, exactly. Don't give it hands or legs, but
then again, you know, don't give it access to a 3D printer. It could be a
problem.

[00:23:27] **Robbie:** Oh yes. Things that can make hands and legs.

[00:23:29] **Chuck:** Mm-hmm. . Exactly. And then skin to go over top of it. I
love that you poured that entire whiskey into that glass and you've committed to
it. You're like, yep, I'm gonna go with

[00:23:38] **Robbie:** trying to drink it. Yeah.

[00:23:40] **Chuck:** I might have a little extra nip. I mean, you know, I, uh,
here it is here. Here's where it finally happened. I'm an alcoholic having
whiskey for breakfast, so if we need to just have a moment in time. When it came
to pass, it was today.

[00:23:55] **Robbie:** Yep. You can point to this episode when you're in
[00:24:00] therapy or at the doctor, or , wherever you're talking

[00:24:02] **Robbie:** about This

[00:24:02] **Chuck:** This is gonna happen. Yeah. When I'm on the street asking
for money by the side of a highway.

[00:24:08] **Robbie:** If you listen to episode 62, that's where it all went
wrong.

[00:24:12] **Chuck:** That's where it all went wrong.

[00:24:14] **Robbie:** I don't, I

[00:24:14] **Chuck:** Need money for rent?

[00:24:16] **Robbie:** I'm not. Something like that. I think we were at 60 of an
episode or two ago, so

[00:24:21] **Chuck:** Yeah. So math would tell you it's in that range. Early
sixties range.

[00:24:25] **Robbie:** yeah.

[00:24:27] **Chuck:** Sixties were a great time growing up. No, not really. I'm
not that old. It's.

[00:24:34] **Robbie:** Yeah. Um, alright, well these are supposed to be short,
so this is probably a good first one and we'll continue down our list of the
things and add more things to the list and just keep chugging through whiskeys
for the next week. So, uh, I don't know, I guess Merry Christmas, happy
holidays, all the things, and we'll catch you in a day on the next one,

[00:24:58] **Chuck:** Merry Christmas [00:25:00] everyone.
